      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know how long you&#39;ve been on the Visual Studio train, but my personal experience started when Visual C++ 6.0 was the only game in the town. MFC and ATL were the major solid libraries that most developers relied on. However, my primary focus of this post is more about the evolution of Visual Studio.Net since 2002.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;welcome-to-my-first-post&#34;&gt;Welcome to my first post!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah! This post is a static HTML page, No dynamic partial fragments, no connection to database, no charges from any CMS website or 3rd party. Unbelievable, isn&#39;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a page written in MarkDown and deployed on GitHub.
Internet and its evolving nature pushed us one more time to a correct direction. 
Obviously, all static pages are faster, less expensive and more straightforward to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
